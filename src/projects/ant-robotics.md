A React redesign of the ANT Robotics landing page. Fully responsive and easily configurable by the client by way of a collection of comprehensive (and comprehensible) JavaScript config files.

I was the lead of a team of three during the development of this site. We used prettier and eslint to ensure consistency and readability. Features some nice geometric animations, a product carousel and an image gallery
