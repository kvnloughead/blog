My first portfolio site, written in React with Styled-Components, and easily configurable via JavaScript config files. Major sections include:

- Sticky navbar
- About the author
- Projects

The projects can be subdivided by type, like backend/frontend. Routing is set up, to allow more detailed description of projects
