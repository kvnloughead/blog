You can use **Alt + \*** to insert all completions at the shell. For instance, if you type `rm foo` followed by tab, and there are multiple files starting with `foo` in the CWD, then you'll see a list of these files. If you want to remove all of them, type **Alt + \*** to insert them all as arguments to `rm`.
