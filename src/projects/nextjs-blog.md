A blog template, based on another template. Written in NextJS using TailwindCSS for styling. Doesn't have a lot of functionality, but does what it says on the tin.

- Articles are written in markdown, parsed by RemarkJS
- Syntax highlighted with PrismJS
- Hand-crafted[^1] support for footnotes

[^1] One might say "hacky"
